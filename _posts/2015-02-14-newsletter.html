<p>I flew home from Australia yesterday. We left Sydney at 5:30pm on Friday and arrived in Los Angeles at noon on Friday. It&#39;s a strange and disorienting experience to spend so many hours on an airplane and then to land in a place -- here or there -- where time has shifted backwards or forwards so significantly. I&#39;m currently reading Rebecca Solnit&#39;s <em>River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West</em>, which has me thinking a lot about technologies and the &quot;annihilation of time and space.&quot; Solnit writes about the railroad and photography; I think about computers and the Internet.</p>

<p>A short newsletter from me this week, because of the weariness from jet lag, the loss of time, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/david_carr/index.html">the loss</a>, <a href="https://musicfordeckchairs.wordpress.com/2015/02/14/the-reality/">the loss</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/02/13/385846609/chapel-hill-shooting-victims-were-radiant-teacher-says">the loss</a>&hellip;</p>

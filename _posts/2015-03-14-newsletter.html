<p>Like a lot of folks, I was surprised this week when the tech publication <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/03/09/about-gigaom/">Gigaom abruptly shut its doors</a>. I swore off reading tech blogs a couple of years ago, I confess, because I couldn&rsquo;t stand the cheery churnalism. But Gigaom was different, offering sharp analysis and not re-written press releases. There&rsquo;s been plenty of talk about <a href="http://recode.net/2015/03/14/the-long-story-behind-gigaoms-sudden-demise/">what went wrong</a> &ndash;<a href="https://medium.com/@dannysullivan/after-gigaom-the-non-vc-simcity-approach-to-growing-a-media-business-b10297a4f2d5">is venture funding a good idea for a media business?</a> &ndash; along with speculation about how financially stable other publications might be.</p>

<p><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/shrug-shrugging-jeff-goldblum-KuzN7sdQLjabm" target="_blank"><img class="tl-email-image" data-id="157913" height="218" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/241ac74f4840cdd291990ed1127d830a538533e3/images/33484851-a092-4370-9e31-cbe053fade96.gif" style="width: 500px; max-width: 500px;" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>The news about Gigaom was particularly striking as it came at the end of the day of a big Apple press fiesta from which reporters breathlessly transcribed everything uttered on stage. My how, the tech blogosphere loves these! The page views! (<a href="https://medium.com/message/apple-watch-liveblog-87efbbf8509f">The best live blog came from Paul Ford and Anil Dash</a>, of course, who didn&rsquo;t even have to attend the event to provide coverage that was better than the rest.) A gold laptop! So thin! New keyboard technology! A new power cord! More data collection &ndash; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/why-apples-new-researchkit-could-have-a-diversity-problem#.htZnLd2ln">for science</a>&rdquo;! A $17,000 watch! Who can resist?!</p>

<p>(Well, John Herrman can apparently: &ldquo;<a href="https://medium.com/matter/shitphone-a-love-story-a44e66434807">I was an iPhone man once, like you. Then Shitphone changed everything</a>.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Meanwhile: &ldquo;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nLe2F3yoZpGcE8JY27UfgB5IObVJtIgdAbiXITEcT4k/edit?usp=sharing">A crash course in privacy and security in the classroom</a>,&rdquo; by Jessy Irwin. And a <a href="http://speakingopenly.co.uk/">series of videos</a> on privacy, trust, and education, featuring Cory Doctorow, Nishant Shah, Dan Gillmor, Ulrich Boser, and me.</p>

<p>And over on Hack Education, I published <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/03/09/hour-of-code">this</a> and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/03/11/men-still-explain">this</a> and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/03/12/calculators">this</a>. I&#39;m not going out of business any time soon...</p>

<p>Yours in struggle,<br />
~Audrey</p>

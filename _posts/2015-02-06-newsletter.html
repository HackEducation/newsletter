<p>I won&#8217;t be swimming with the Left Shark. <a href="https://gigaom.com/2015/02/05/katy-perrys-lawyers-demand-takedown-of-3d-printable-left-shark/"><strong>Katy Perry</strong> owns the Left Shark</a>.

<p>Speaking of questions about authorship and authors&#8217; work: &#8220;<strong>[Alan Turing</strong>&#8217;s lost notes discovered as crumpled insulation in Bletchley Park huts](http://boingboing.net/2015/02/04/alan-turings-lost-notes-disc.html).&#8221; Wikipedia editor &#8220;Giraffedata&#8221; has some <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/meet-the-ultimate-wikignome-10508842caad">15,000 edits to entries</a> that mis-use the phrase &#8220;comprised of.&#8221; And speaking of readers: &#8220;<a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/zunguzungu/you-are-totally-unreliable-twitter/">You are totally unreliable Twitter</a>&#8221; says <strong>Aaron Bady</strong>.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Happened When The Chronicle Sat Down With Steve Jobs Back in 1998?&#8221; writes Jeffrey Young in <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/190173/">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. (You can listen to the audio of the interview <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chronicleofhighered/steve-jobs-audio">here</a>.) &#8220;Some of the best ideas we&#8217;ve ever had come from higher ed,&#8221; Jobs says. Go figure. There <em>is</em> <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/02/19/the-history-of-the-future-of-education/">a long history</a> that connects education and technology, though you mightn&#8217;t know it if you listened to <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/02/17/horizon/">some of the pundits</a> from the disrupto-sector or if you get all your info <a href="http://www.uncomputing.org/?p=1622">from Wikipedia</a>.</p>

And Jacqui Shine on <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/02/kukla_fran_and_ollie_the_gentle_puppets_that_bewitched_america_in_the_1950s.single.html"><em>Kukla, Fran and Ollie</em></a>. </p>

<p>Responses: <a href="http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/culture/video-games/168413-gamergate-svu-episode-reviewed-by-leigh-alexander">To Law &amp; Order SVU&#8217;s &#8220;Gamergate&#8221; episode</a>. <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/zunguzungu/on-landings-soft-and-otherwise-and-aggressive-lacks-of-proportion/">To <em>The New York Times</em> suggesting that a tweet ruined Justine Sacco&#8217;s life</a>.</p>

<p>Physics teacher Moses Rifkin wrote about &#8220;<a href="https://quantumprogress.wordpress.com/2015/02/12/guest-post-teaching-social-justice-in-the-physics-classroom-part-1/">Teaching Social Justice in the Physics Classroom</a>&#8221; &#8211; a wonderful series of posts &#8211; and you&#8217;ll never guess what happened next. (Actually, you probably will. <a href="https://twitter.com/RiPhysKin/status/568062409581031425">Fox News</a> picked up the story, blaming Rifkin for the US&#8217;s low achievement in math and science.)</p>

<p>Yours in struggle,</p>

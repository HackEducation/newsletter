<p>So <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-flight-catalog-skymall-files-for-bankruptcy-1422025308">Skymall is filing for bankruptcy</a>. And perhaps there are <a href="http://edinsanity.com/2010/12/10/educational-technology-as-the-skymall-catalog/">some lessons there</a> for folks in ed-tech who gleefully tout the hundreds of &#8220;innovative products&#8221; (code for &#8220;ridiculous crap&#8221;) that you can start using in your classroom today.</p>

<p>This week, on Hack Education, I looked at the marketing for Art Instruction, Inc, (founded in 1914) whose <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/01/20/draw-me/">&#8220;Draw Me&#8221; ads</a> beckoned people to take correspondence courses on commercial art &#8220;for pleasure and profit.&#8221; It&#8217;s an appeal that echoes those of MOOCs, I argue, particularly those offering &#8220;high tech skills.&#8221; How is this appeal gendered and raced? Who is envisioned as the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/why-i-am-not-a-maker/384767/">maker</a>, the <a href="http://hapgood.us/2015/01/23/users/">user</a>, the builder, the artist?</p>

<p>Who is envisioned as the model student? Writing in <em>Model View Culture</em>,<a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/exclusion-and-exceptionality-in-the-pipeline"><strong>Julia Nguyen</strong> observes</a>, &#8220;In computer science classrooms across high schools and universities, minorities are excluded and exit early in the pipeline. Along with the pressure to keep up with our &#8216;exceptional&#8217; peers, we face the pressure of being a model minority or a success story.&#8221;</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the future of higher education? <strong>Mills Kelly</strong> looks at the effect free community college might have on history departments: in three parts. <a href="http://edwired.org/2015/01/19/free-for-all/">1</a>, <a href="http://edwired.org/2015/01/21/free-for-all-2/">2</a>, <a href="http://edwired.org/2015/01/23/free-for-all-3/">3</a>. &#8220;ASU is the &#8216;New American University&#8217; &#8211; It&#8217;s Terrifying,&#8221; <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/asu-new-american-university-its-terrifying">says <strong>John Warner</strong></a>. It is indeed.</p>

<p>But at least we can agree on this <em>Fortune</em> headline: &#8220;<a href="http://fortune.com/2015/01/21/everybody-hates-pearson/">Everybody Hates Pearson</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some thoughts on the future of tech: <strong>Jill Lepore</strong> in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb"><em>The New Yorker</em> on the Internet Archive</a>. <strong>Vauhini Vara</strong> in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/less-annoying-future-google-glass"><em>The New Yorker</em> on Google Glass</a>. <strong>Jim Groom</strong> on &#8220;<a href="http://bavatuesdays.com/how-automobiles-super-highways-and-containerization-helped-me-understand-the-future-of-the-web/">How Automobiles, Super Highways, and Containerization helped me understand the future of the Web</a>.&#8221; <strong>Ben Werdm√ºller</strong> on &#8220;<a href="http://werd.io/2015/censorship-and-silos">Censorship and Silos</a>.&#8221; <strong>Lilly Irani</strong> on &#8220;<a href="http://www.publicbooks.org/nonfiction/justice-for-data-janitors">Justice for &#8216;Data Janitors&#8217;</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down with Richard Scarry&#8217;s BusyTown. Down with this stupid sickness that has me missing Educon this weekend. Three cheers for the <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/01/23/radical-brownies-girls-of-col.html">Radical Brownies</a>.</p>

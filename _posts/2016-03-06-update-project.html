<p>I wanted to make it easier for people to sign up for the various newsletters that I publish. Up until now, the only link I&#8217;ve provided on my sites is for the newsletter I send on Saturdays via Tinyletter.</p>

<p>I also send newsletters via Mailchimp &#8211; these are essentially RSS-to-email versions from Hack Education and my personal blog. The former comes out whenever I update the blog; the latter comes out once a week. (There is currently no RSS-to-email subscription for the posts I post on my &#8220;<a href="http://withknown.com/">Known</a>&#8221; site, aud.life. I kind of like it that way, since I&#8217;m using that site as a sketchpad, of sorts, to think and write through ideas.)</p>

<p>To make a long story short: I&#8217;ve updated the Newsletter link that&#8217;s in the footer of all my sites so that it points to news.hackeducation.com rather than just the Tinyletter sign-up page. Two clicks to sign up isn&#8217;t so streamlined, I suppose. Oh well. </p>

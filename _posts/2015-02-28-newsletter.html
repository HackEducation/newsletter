<p>I re-watched the old <em>Star Trek</em> episode &#8220;Spock&#8217;s Brain&#8221; last night, thinking I might write something for <a href="https://medium.com/the-history-of-the-future-of-education">my series on the history of education technology</a>. The episode is often derided as the worst of the entire series &#8211; I don&#8217;t dispute that &#8211; but it does highlight how we thought in 1968 (how we still think) about brains, thinking, teaching, and machines. </p>

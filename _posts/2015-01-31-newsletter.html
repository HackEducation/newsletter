<p><a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2015/01/31/a-note-to-my-readers/">Blogging is dead</a>! Long live blogging! <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/01/25/aNoteAboutBlogging.html">As <strong>Dave Winer</strong> writes</a>, &ldquo;A good blog exists independently of people reading it. Even if no one read my blog, I&rsquo;d still write it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rather than see the end of blogging signaled by <strong>Andrew Sullivan</strong>&rsquo;s retirement, I&rsquo;d rather see the end of &ldquo;Hot Takes.&rdquo; There were a lot of Garbage Hot Takes and at least one Garbage Hot Take Poem this week, to which I will not bother to link or even &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/introducing-the-supertweet/384730/">supertweet</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/susie_c/status/560570864148557824" target="_blank"><img class="tl-email-image" data-id="112813" height="469" src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/241ac74f4840cdd291990ed1127d830a538533e3/images/423c917c-8f59-4d45-8de4-37a6c4a18a80.png" style="width: 357px; max-width: 357px;" width="357" /></a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to discourage folks from writing. &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.ameliagreenhall.com/post/start-your-own-brand-everything-i-know-about-starting-collaborative-feminist-publications">Start Your Own B(r)and!</a>&rdquo; Just please write smart things like: <strong>Jeet Heer</strong> on <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120884/new-republics-legacy-race"><em>The New Republic</em>&rsquo;s racist past</a>; <strong>Sarah Jaffe</strong> on &ldquo;<a href="http://theweek.com/articles/536184">the subversive brilliance of <strong>Marshawn Lynch</strong></a>&rdquo;; <strong>Andy Baio</strong> on <a href="https://medium.com/message/never-trust-a-corporation-to-do-a-librarys-job-f58db4673351">the importance of the Internet Archive</a>; <strong>Robin James</strong> on <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/cloudy-logic/">big data as astrology</a>; <strong>Dana Goldstein</strong> on <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/01/26/in-your-face">using pepper-spray and tear gas on students</a>; <strong>Alec Macgillis</strong> on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/testing-time"><strong>Jeb Bush</strong>&rsquo;s &ldquo;educational experiment&rdquo;</a>; and <strong>Quinn Norton</strong> on <a href="https://medium.com/message/we-should-all-step-back-from-security-journalism-e474cd67e2fa">infosec journalism</a>, for example.</p>

<p>February 28, 1967: &ldquo;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Day-the-Purpose-of-College/151359/">The Day the Purpose of College Changed</a>&rdquo; when then California Governor <strong>Ronald Reagan</strong> dismissed universities as &ldquo;intellectual luxuries that perhaps we could do without.&rdquo; Today, education continues to be <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/higher-education-is-not-a-mixtape/384845/">redefined</a>, with a focus on <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-code-school-industrial-complex">skills and jobs</a> rather than inquiry or curiosity.</p>

<p>And the technology industry and its army of VCs keep trying to play a larger role in that, all while rewriting and erasing the history of previous accomplishments and alternatives. <a href="http://newleftreview.org/II/91/evgeny-morozov-socialize-the-data-centres">According to <strong>Evgeny Morozov</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;These Internet debates tend to operate with a kind of amnesia, narrating everything in a kind of abstracted history of technology.</p>
<br />
<p>There&rsquo;s a story to be told even about Google&rsquo;s main ranking algorithm, which actually comes out of decades of work on information science and indexing. The mechanism that Google uses to determine which items are relevant or not&mdash;by looking at who links to what, citation patterns etc&mdash;was developed in relation to the indexing of academic literature; it&rsquo;s not their own invention. But you would never guess that without knowing something about developments in information science. Likewise, people looking at these &lsquo;massive open online courses&rsquo; today don&rsquo;t generally know that in the fifties and sixties people like <strong>B. F. Skinner</strong> were promoting what he called &lsquo;teaching machines&rsquo; that would dispense with an instructor. There&rsquo;s a continuous tradition of trying to automate education. The fact that a bunch of start-ups have now moved into the area does not erase those earlier developments. Now that &lsquo;the Internet&rsquo; is spreading into everything&mdash;education, healthcare (with the &lsquo;quantified self&rsquo;), and all the rest&mdash;we&rsquo;re in danger of ending up with a kind of idiot history, in which everything starts in Silicon Valley, and there are no other forces or causes.</p>

<p>According to Wired, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/01/rodney-mullen/">Silicon Valley Has Lost Its Way. Can Skateboarding Legend <strong>Rodney Mullen</strong> Help It?</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quick programming note: I am moving HEWN, the Hack Education Weekly Newsletter, from Tinyletter to Substack. If you are currently a subscriber (as of today), you won&#8217;t need to do anything. Your subscription will move over there, thanks to the magic of exporting and importing email addresses in a CSV format.</p>

<p>If you are not a subscriber, you can sign up here: <a href="http://hewn.substack.com">hewn.substack.com</a>.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of Substack is that it handles archives much more nicely. So even if you don&#8217;t subscribe, you will be able to read the emails there. (I have no plans at this time to charge for my newsletter, a feature that Substack does offer.)</p>

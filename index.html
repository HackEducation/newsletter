<p><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i>  <strong>Hack Education RSS-to-Email</strong>: This newsletter, as the name suggests, sends a full copy of all new blog posts from Hack Education to your email inbox. Sent via Mailchimp, this newsletter is sent automatically every time Hack Education is updated. <a href="http://hackeducation.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0ab07657df870af8eb101b4e5&amp;id=62da8beb59">Sign up here</a>. <em>Note: as of August 2020, Mailchimp has closed my account because the company is stupid.

<p><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>  <strong>Audreywatters.com RSS-to-Email</strong>: This newsletter, as the name suggests, sends a full copy of all new blog posts from my personal blog to your email inbox. Sent via Mailchimp, this newsletter is sent automatically once a week (on Mondays). <a href="http://hackeducation.us5.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=0ab07657df870af8eb101b4e5&amp;id=3ca19b5f4f">Sign up here</a>. <em>Note: as of August 2020, Mailchimp has closed my account because the company is stupid and says the account was inactive, even though it regularly sends out rss-to-email newsletters. Jerks. This newsletter is now on hold.</em></p>

<p><em>I will not sell or share these mailing lists with anyone</em>. Hell, I rarely look at who&#8217;s signed up or who&#8217;s un-enrolled because I don&#8217;t give a damn about analytics. (That being said, the services that operate these newsletters do have privacy policies that you should read.) </p>

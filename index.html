<h2>How to Read My Work Via Email</h2>
<br />
<p>My newsletters are currently on hiatus. Once it's time to promote <em>Teaching Machines</em>, I'm sure I'll figure out some way to email you. But don't worry: I will not sell or share my mailing list with anyone</em>. Hell, I rarely look at who&#8217;s signed up or who&#8217;s un-enrolled because I don&#8217;t give a damn about analytics.</p>
